# MURANO-QUESTION1
Code for question 1 - sorting algorithms.\
The code was written in python for easier plotting.\
To run it, the user just needs to run the file with a python interpreter, containing the [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html) library.\
The times calculated are only for n = 10<sup>x</sup>, x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\
The runtime of bubble sort was only calculated for x = 1, 2, 3, 4, given that it would take too much time to run bubble sort with bigger arrays.
